# droid-terminal
Just a cpp that when ran grants access to sh/Terminal on android systems

this was made as a hyper-focus project after I wondered if using system calls to work with android would work. started off as just that, then turned into me beginning my own terminal, but then i discovered 'sh' as a system() argument and suddenly i had access to Android's CLI
